# A Spotlight
for developer relations @ github
.footnote[by tom callaway<BR>2020-05-27]
???
I made this!
---
.center[![Total Eclipse of the Octocat](https://octodex.github.com/images/total-eclipse-of-the-octocat.jpg)]

???
There is no dispute. GitHub is the largest home for open source.
But with over 50 million users and almost 40 million repositories, getting a project noticed can be challenging.
---

.left-column[
  ### Goals
]
.right-column[
To gain momenentum, early-stage open source projects need to:

- find new users

- find new contributors
]
???
Early-stage open source projects face a daunting challenge as they attempt to accomplish two fundamental goals: 
finding new users and finding new contributors. These goals are key to both the health and the growth of the project.
---
.left-column[
  ### Goals
  ### The Path
]
.right-column[
- These goals are connected

- No one contributes to an open source project they do not use.red[*]

.footnote[.red[*] Okay, almost no one]
]
???
These two goals are tied to each other since virtually no one contributes to an open source project that they do not use personally. Over time, some users become “power users”, some “power users” become contributors, and some contributors become “top contributors”, eventually even maintainers.

<img src="FOSS-contributor-pyramid.png" width="400" alt="a pyramid divided into different colored segments, each segment has an arrow pointing to the one above it, and the segments are labeled, in order from bottom to top: USERS, POWER USERS, CONTRIBUTORS, MAINTAINERS"> 
]
]
???
This evolution can be modeled as a pyramid. At each stage of the pyramid, some people will stay at the level they are at, but in a healthy project, a percentage of participants will move up over time.

<strong>New open source projects need to find new users to grow, but it is hard for them to stand out amongst the large numbers of projects on GitHub.</strong>
]
???
Understanding this allows us to simplify the problem statement to:
New open source projects need to find new users to grow, but it is hard for them to stand out amongst the large numbers of projects on GitHub.

![Screen capture of the GitHub Trending page](trending.png)
]
???
Traditionally, the burden of raising awareness of an open source project falls almost entirely onto the project, but GitHub does provide some tooling to assist them today.
The concept of “stars” provides an indicator of the popularity (and possibly, usage) of a repository. While a large number of stars is a good metric for identifying a healthy open source project in a mature stage, this is not expected for an open source project in an early stage.
Since a high star rating (per day) is important to being featured on the GitHub trending page, it is less likely that new open source projects will be found here.

Initially, I suggest a 3-month period for achieving these key results.

# GitHub Open Source <BR><BR> Spotlight Program

.footnote[the idea]
???
GitHub, with help with volunteers from the wider open source community, will select some early-stage open source projects (that live on GitHub) to be promoted as Github Open Source Spotlight Projects.
---
.left-column[
  ### Promotion
]
.right-column[
* A dedicated collection featuring the winners
* A dedicated page for the program on github.com
* Blog write ups of the project (including interviews from the maintainer(s)
* Social media posts promoting the winning projects (not just reshares)
* A graphical badge
]
---
.left-column[
  ### Promotion     
  ### Focus Areas
]
.right-column[
* Artistic/Creative
* Gaming
* Humanitarian
* Infrastructure
* Mobile
* Scientific
* Web Application
]
???
GitHub has an excellent infrastructure for enabling repositories to provide category metadata about their repository through “topics”. I suggest we take advantage of that, and choose several topics for this program (beyond “open source”) as focus areas.
This list is obviously up for debate, and should be reinforced with metrics of which topics are popular before any launch-instance of the program.
---

.left-column[
  ### Promotion
  ### Focus Areas
  ### Hey, you forgot...
]
.right-column[
  There are any number of other focus areas that could be chosen:
* Back End
* Blockchain/Cryptocurrency
* CI/CD
* Cloud 
* Container
* Database
* Education
* Embedded/IOT
* Front End
* Machine Learning
* $PROGRAMMING_LANGUAGE
* QE
]
???
This gives an idea of the strong potential this program can have across multiple technology categories. Initially, the program should start simple, with focus area categories that have minimal overlap, but are likely to have good applicants (both in quality and quantity). We can always evolve our focus areas over time.
---
template: inverse
class: middle, center

# 5 x 7 = 35 .red[*]

.footnote[.red[*]140 per year]
???
There should be at least five featured projects in each category per quarter (3 months). For the seven proposed focus areas, there would be 35 projects per quarter (and 140 per year).

]
]
???
Some projects may not want promotion. They may be content to be just as they are, and we should respect that. To be considered for inclusion in the OSSP, projects should opt-in.
To start the application process, we should have projects complete a smart web form. I emphasize smart here, because we do not want this to feel like doing your taxes.
This form should contain a checklist of the criteria for consideration, with as many of them auto-checked as possible. The GitHub API should be able to help us here.
---

## The <span style="color: red;">Heart</span> of our Criteria
<BR>
[![Screenshot of opensource.guide](opensource.guide.png)](https://opensource.guide/)

???
GitHub already has some great guides for Open Source Software, specifically everything at opensource.guide and the Building A Strong Community section in the GitHub Enterprise docs.
These reference materials are excellent, and we want to encourage early-stage open source projects on GitHub to follow the advice they provide. By pointing to them explicitly, we not 
only guide people to them, but we also help projects know what we are looking for them to do well.

.right-column[
 * <strong>Below</strong> a certain threshold of stars

]
???
We are not trying to help already popular projects, so projects should be below a certain threshold of stars. (I’m honestly not sure what this threshold should be, my best guess is 1000, but even that may be too high or too low.)
---
.left-column[

### - Function
]
.right-column[
 * The project needs to work.
    * Not perfect, not feature complete, just able to do something
 * Tell us what it can do today.
    * Include anything known to be missing/broken
]
???
The project needs to work. It doesn’t need to do everything or be perfect, but it needs to actually have function. This program is not about “idea” repositories that are hoping someone will show up and start actual creation. The project should be able to point to a revision, tell us what works (and what they know is missing/broken), and be judged on that. We will be forgiving, but only to a point.
---
.left-column[
  ## Criteria
### - Qualified
### - License
### - Topics
### - Stars
### - Function
### - Prepared
]
.right-column[
Projects need to have:
* A README.md of substance (e.g. word count)
* A set of contributing guidelines
    * CONTRIBUTING
* A code of conduct
    * CODE_OF_CONDUCT
* How to get help
    * SUPPORT
* Documentation beyond README
    * Does not need to be complete
* An issue template
    * ISSUE_TEMPLATE

### - Legal
]
.right-column[
* Agree to the legal terms and conditions
]
???
This is a contest, at least legally. We need to get legal terms/rules/conditions created and have them agree to those terms here.
---
## Project Information
* Ask smart questions that cannot be autogenerated, to be answered in the applicant's own words
    * Not essays, just a few sentences
* Some suggestions
    * What is the purpose of your project?
    * How is it unique?
    * What features/functionality do you hope to add? (TODO)
    * Why do you want to be featured as a GitHub Open Source Spotlight Project?
???
This will give us a better sense of the project and also help craft messaging when the project is being promoted within the program, if accepted.

]
.right-column[
<BR><BR>

]
???
The amount of people in the reviewing teams should reflect the scope of the work as much as possible, but it should not be too small to avoid burdening any single person, nor too big. The idea is to divide out the applications for review in groups, then take the average of the scores to determine the top 20, then 5 winners.
We should consider some way of thanking reviewers (internally and externally) for their time. Possibly program-branded swag or some other item of reasonable monetary value.
---
## Measuring Success .red[*]

* Star count after being featured
* Number of repository clones
* Number of repository forks
* Number of release downloads
* Number of new pull requests
* Number of new issues opened
* Number of additional unique contributors
* Social media likes, reshares, and click-through percentages
* Did this project make it to the Trending page?

.footnote[.red[*] With data!]
???
All of these metrics should be done by count and percentage growth. It should be possible to automate their collection via GitHub API calls, and they should be generated at regular intervals to see how the impact of the program holds over time. While they go beyond helping to measure the initial Key Results, they help us to see a more complete picture of the impact of the program, as well as to inform future evolutions of our key results.
---
template: inverse
class: middle, center

# TRANSPARENCY
???
Since open source requires transparency, we should post an annual report detailing the program’s metrics in aggregate (not per project, as we do not want this to have a negative effect on any featured projects which do not grow).
---
## Resources needed

* Reviewers to look over submissions (internal and external)
* Marketing resources to promote winners via web and social
* Marketing resources to promote the program (to get applicants)
* Creative resources to create a brand for this program
* Technical resources to build and maintain the application form
* Budget for branded swag
---
## Risks

* We can’t do this because of legal restrictions
    * It’s more likely that there will be people in locales who are not eligible
* No one applies
* Very few projects apply (“the best of the worst”)
* Too many projects apply (“so much hay!”)
* Our promotional efforts do not have enough impact (“lighter fluid does not burn”)
* We highlight a project and discover they’re stuck in an early stage of maturity due to their own unhealthy behavior (which they are unable or unwilling to correct) that our reviewers didn’t catch
* Not enough people to review projects (either internal or external)
---
## Nice to haves

* Program specific swag
    * Unique octocat sticker
    * Anything appropriate with the program branding
* A cash stipend for the featured projects
    * Look to Google Summer of Code for guidance on how to manage this
* Project demo in the GitHub booth at a major open source event
    * Provide funding for a project rep to attend the event and give their demo
    * Not the whole GH booth, just a featured area
* Expand program from a quarterly recognition model to a more frequent recognition
    * Add an annual winner?
* Create a community of applicants and engage them
